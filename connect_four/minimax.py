# In this python file the AI is written. for the AI is the minimax algorithm used. To write this code YiÄŸit PIRILDAK his blog was used: 
# https://levelup.gitconnected.com/mastering-tic-tac-toe-with-minimax-algorithm-3394d65fa88f

# The minimax algorithm consist of two functions
#   -   The first function (find_best_move) is used to call te AI in the main python script. here everyting needed for the algorithm is 
#       collected and the first loop of the algorithm is called. Whitin the function the other function is called. The function returns 
#       the column of the best move.
#   -   The second function (minimax) is the main part of the algoritm. It consist of a max_turn and a not max_turn which means who's 
#       turn it is. if the AI is at turn, max_turn is True because we want to maximise the result. if the opponent is at turn, max_turn 
#       is False because we want to minimize the result. each consist of the same three parts further explained in the code.
